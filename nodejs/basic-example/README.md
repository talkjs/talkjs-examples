# TalkJS and Node.js backend example

This is an example project for TalkJS's tutorial on [how to build a Node.js chat app with TalkJS](https://talkjs.com/resources/how-to-add-chat-into-a-nodejs-app-with-talkjs/).

This example demonstrates how to integrate TalkJS with an application that has a Node.js backend. There are two projects inside the repo:

- The `talkjs-backend` project contains the Node.js backend, which serves a REST endpoint with user data.
- The `talkjs-frontend` project contains the frontend code, which uses TalkJS's [JavaScript SDK](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/JavaScript_Chat_SDK/) to create chats between users.
