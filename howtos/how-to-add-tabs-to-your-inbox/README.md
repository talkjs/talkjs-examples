- A [TalkJS account](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/)

## How to run the tutorial

1. Clone or [download this project](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/releases/latest/download/howtos.how-to-add-tabs-to-your-inbox.zip).
2. Go to `index.js`, and replace `<APP_ID>` with your own app ID. You can find your app ID on the **Settings** page of the [TalkJS dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/).

Conversations only show up in the conversation list in the inbox [if the conversation contains at least one message](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Chat_UI_Modes/The_Inbox/#conversations-in-the-inbox). To try out the inbox tab filtering, create at least one 1-on-1 conversation (direct message), and one group chat.
