# TalkJS and React example

This is a basic example that demonstrates how to integrate TalkJS into a React app with the [classic React SDK](https://talkjs.com/docs/UI_Components/React/Classic/Installation/), bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This example uses React version 18. You can use the classic React SDK with versions 17 and up.
