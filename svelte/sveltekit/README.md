# TalkJS SvelteKit Example

This example shows how to integrate TalkJS with SvelteKit in the simplest way. For a more idiomatic Svelte integration that minimises use of `onMount`, see `sveltekit-typescript-wrapper`.

Open `/src/lib/talkJsConfig.ts` and replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your own appId which you can find in the [TalkJS Dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard)

Run `npm install && npm run dev` to start the example on port 5000.
